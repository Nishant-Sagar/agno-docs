Agno is a high-performance runtime for multi-agent systems. Use it to build, run and manage secure agent systems in your cloud.

**Agno gives you:**

1. The fastest framework for building agents, multi-agent teams and agentic workflows with built-in memory, knowledge, reasoning, human in the loop and native multi-modal support.
2. A high-performance runtime for secure, enterprise-grade multi-agent systems in your cloud called the AgentOS, which comes with pre-built API endpoints you can use to build your agentic product.
3. A powerful platform for monitoring, managing and testing your agentic system.

For organizations building agents, Agno provides the complete solution. You get the fastest framework for building your agentic system, an API for running it in production and a control plane for managing your production system.

Agno brings a novel architecture that no other framework provides, your AgentOS runs securely in your cloud, and the control plane connects directly to it. You don't need to send traces to external services or pay per trace costs, giving you complete privacy and control.

## Getting started

If you're new to Agno, start by [building your first Agent](/introduction/first-agent) and run it using the AgentOS.
