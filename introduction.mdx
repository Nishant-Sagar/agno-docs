Agno is a high-performance runtime for multi-agent systems. Use it to build, run and manage secure multi-agent systems in your cloud.

**Agno gives you:**

1. The fastest framework for building agents and multi-agent workflows.
2. A high-performance runtime for your multi-agent systems called the AgentOS.
3. Built-in session management, memory, knowledge, human in the loop and MCP support.
4. SSE compatible API endpoints for building your agentic product.
5. A powerful platform for monitoring and managing your AgentOS.

For organizations building agents, Agno provides the complete solution. You get the fastest framework for building agents (speed of development and execution), a pre-built FastAPI app that lets you build your product on day one, and a control plane for managing your system.

We bring a novel architecture that no other framework provides, your AgentOS runs securely in your cloud, and the control plane connects directly to it. You don't need to send traces to external services or pay retention costs, you get complete data privacy and control.

## Getting started

If you're new to Agno, start by [building your first Agent](/introduction/first-agent) and run it using the AgentOS.

After that, checkout the [examples gallery](/examples/introduction) and build real-world applications with Agno.
