Agno is a high-performance runtime for multi-agent systems. Use it to build, run and manage secure multi-agent systems in your cloud.

**Agno gives you:**

1. The fastest framework for building agents, multi-agent teams and agentic workflows with session management, memory, knowledge, human in the loop and multi-modal support.
2. A high-performance runtime for running secure, enterprise-grade multi-agent systems in your cloud called the AgentOS.
3. A powerful platform for monitoring and managing your AgentOS.

For organizations building agents, Agno provides the complete solution. You get the fastest framework for building your agentic system, an API for running it in production and a control plane for managing your production system.

<Tip>

This is a systems engineering problem and Agno gives you the right tools for the job.

</Tip>

Agno gives you a novel architecture that no other framework provides, your AgentOS runs securely in your cloud, and the control plane connects directly to it. You don't need to send traces to external services or pay retention costs, you get complete data privacy and control.

## Getting started

If you're new to Agno, start by [building your first Agent](/introduction/first-agent) and run it using the AgentOS.
