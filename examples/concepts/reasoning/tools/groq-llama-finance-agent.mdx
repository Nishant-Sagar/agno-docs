## Code

from textwrap import dedent

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.groq import Groq
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

    ## General Instructions
    - Always start by using the think tool to map out the steps needed to complete the task.
    - After receiving tool results, use the think tool as a scratchpad to validate the results for correctness
    - Before responding to the user, use the think tool to jot down final thoughts and ideas.
    - Present final outputs in well-organized tables whenever possible.

    ## Using the think tool
    At every step, use the think tool as a scratchpad to:
    - Restate the object in your own words to ensure full comprehension.
    - List the  specific rules that apply to the current request
    - Check if all required information is collected and is valid
    - Verify that the planned action completes the task\
