Agno supports in-memory session storage for agents, which stores conversation history in memory during the session.

## Usage

By default, agents use in-memory storage when no database is specified. You can control how much history is included in the context.

```python in_memory_session_storage.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from rich.pretty import pprint

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    # Set add_history_to_context=true to add the previous chat history to the context sent to the Model.
    add_history_to_context=True,
    # Number of historical responses to add to the messages.
    num_history_runs=3,
    description="You are a helpful assistant that always responds in a polite, upbeat and positive manner.",
)

# Create a run
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story", stream=True)

# Print the messages in the memory
pprint(
    [
        m.model_dump(include={"role", "content"})
        for m in agent.get_messages_for_session()
    ]
)

# Ask a follow up question that continues the conversation
agent.print_response("What was my first message?", stream=True)

# Print the messages in the memory
pprint(
    [
        m.model_dump(include={"role", "content"})
        for m in agent.get_messages_for_session()
    ]
)
```
