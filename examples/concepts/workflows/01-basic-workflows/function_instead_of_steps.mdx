title: Function instead of steps
description: This example demonstrates how to use just a single function instead of steps in a workflow.
---

This example demonstrates **Workflows** using a single custom execution function instead of 
discrete steps. This pattern gives you complete control over the orchestration logic while still 
benefiting from workflow features like storage, streaming, and session management.

**When to use**: When you need maximum flexibility and control over the execution flow, similar 
to Workflows 1.0 approach but with a better structured approach.
