title: "Session State in Instructions"
---

This example demonstrates how to use session state variables directly in team instructions using template syntax. The session state values are automatically injected into the instructions, making them available to the team during execution.

## Code

```python cookbook/examples/teams/state/session_state_in_instructions.py
from agno.team.team import Team

team = Team(
    members=[],
    # Initialize the session state with a variable
    session_state={"user_name": "John"},
    instructions="Users name is {user_name}",
    markdown=True,
)

team.print_response("What is my name?", stream=True)
```
