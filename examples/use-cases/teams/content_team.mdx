from agno.team import Team
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

# Create individual specialized agents
researcher = Agent(

    role="Expert at finding information",
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    model=OpenAIChat("gpt-5-mini"),
)

writer = Agent(
    name="Writer",
    role="Expert at writing clear, engaging content",
    model=OpenAIChat("gpt-5-mini"),
)

# Create a team with these agents
content_team = Team(

    instructions="You are a team of researchers and writers that work together to create high-quality content.",
    model=OpenAIChat("gpt-5-mini"),
