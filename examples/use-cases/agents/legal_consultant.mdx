title: Legal Consultant
---

This example demonstrates how to create a specialized AI agent that provides legal information and guidance based on a knowledge base of legal documents. The Legal Consultant agent is designed to help users understand legal concepts, consequences, and procedures by leveraging a vector database of legal content.

**Key Features:**
- **Legal Knowledge Base**: Integrates with a PostgreSQL vector database containing legal documents and resources
- **Document Processing**: Automatically ingests and indexes legal PDFs from authoritative sources (e.g., Department of Justice manuals)
- **Contextual Responses**: Provides relevant legal information with proper citations and sources
- **Professional Disclaimers**: Always clarifies that responses are for informational purposes only, not professional legal advice
- **Attorney Referrals**: Recommends consulting licensed attorneys for specific legal situations

**Use Cases:**
- Legal research and education
- Understanding criminal penalties and consequences
- Learning about legal procedures and requirements
- Getting preliminary legal information before consulting professionals
