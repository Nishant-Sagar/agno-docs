title: Company Description Workflow
description: A workflow that generates comprehensive supplier profiles by gathering information from multiple sources and delivers them via email.
---

## Overview

This workflow combines web crawling, search engines, Wikipedia, and competitor analysis to create detailed supplier profiles. It processes company information through 4 specialized agents running in parallel, then generates a structured markdown report and sends it via email.

The workflow uses workflow session state management to cache analysis results. If the same supplier is analyzed again, it returns cached results instead of re-running the expensive analysis pipeline.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- OpenAI API key
- Resend API key for emails [https://resend.com/api-keys]
- Firecrawl API key for web crawling [https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys]

### Quick Setup
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export RESEND_API_KEY="your-resend-key"
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="your-firecrawl-key"
```

Install dependencies
```
pip install agno openai firecrawl-py resend
```

## Code Structure

This company description workflow consists of three main files:

### 1. Agents (`agents.py`)

Specialized agents for gathering information from multiple sources:

```python agents.py

```

### 2. Prompts (`prompts.py`)

You are a supplier profile agent. You are given a supplier name, results from the supplier homepage and search results regarding the supplier, and Wikipedia results regarding the supplier. You need to be extremely verbose in your response. Do not filter out any content.

You are tasked with generating a segment of a supplier profile. The segment will be provided to you. Make sure to format it in markdown.

General format:

Title: [Title of the segment]

[Segment]

Formatting Guidelines:
1. Ensure the profile is structured, clear, and to the point.
2. Avoid assumptions—only include verified details.
3. Use bullet points and short paragraphs for readability.
4. Cite sources where applicable for credibility.

Objective: This supplier profile should serve as a reliable reference document for businesses evaluating potential suppliers. The details should be extracted from official sources, search results, and any other reputable databases. The profile must provide an in-depth understanding of the supplier's operational, competitive, and financial position to support informed decision-making.

## Usage Example

```python
# Create supplier profile request
supplier_request = SupplierProfile(
    supplier_name="Your Company Name",
    supplier_homepage_url="https://yourcompany.com",
    user_email="your.email@company.com",
)

# Run the workflow
company_description_workflow.print_response(
