The AgentOS is a RESTful API that provides access to your agentic system.

It allows you to:

- **Run Agents / Teams / Workflows**: Create new runs for your agents, teams and workflows, either with a new session or a existing one.
- **Manage Sessions**: Retrieve, update and delete sessions.
- **Manage Memories**: Retrieve, update and delete memories.
- **Manage Knowledge**: Manage the content of your knowledge base.
- **Manage Evals**: Retrieve, create, delete and update evals.

<Note>
This same API is what powers the AgentOS Control Plane. However, these endpoints can be very useful for other applications!

See the full [API reference](/reference-api/overview) for more details.

## Authentication

AgentOS supports bearer-token authentication to secure your instance. 
When a Security Key is configured, all API routes require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for access. Without a key configured, authentication is disabled.

For more details, see the [AgentOS Security](/agent-os/security) guide.
