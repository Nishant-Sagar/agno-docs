## Overview

The Memories feature in AgentOS provides a centralized view of information that agents have learned and stored about you as a user. Memory gives agents the ability to recall information about you across conversations, enabling personalized and contextual interactions.

- Memories are automatically created and updated after each agent run
- Each memory is tied to a specific user ID and contains learned information
- Memories include content, topics, timestamps, and the input that generated them
- Agents with memory enabled can learn about you and provide more relevant responses over time

<Note>
  <strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Your AgentOS must be connected and active. If
  you see "Disconnected" or "Inactive," review your{" "}
  <a href="/agent-os/connecting-your-os">connection settings</a>.
</Note>

## Memory Management

The memory interface allows you to:

1. **Create memories** - Create memories your agents can reference during chat sessions
2. **View by topics** - See memories organized by thematic categories
3. **Edit memories** - Update or correct stored information as needed
4. **Delete memories** - Remove outdated or incorrect information
5. **Monitor memory creation** - See when and from what inputs memories were generated

<Tip>
  Memories are automatically generated from your conversations, but you can also
  manually create, edit, or remove them.

## Privacy and Control

- All memories are tied to your specific user ID and stored in your AgentOS database
- Memories are only accessible to agents within your connected OS instance
- Memory data remains within your deployment and is never shared externally
