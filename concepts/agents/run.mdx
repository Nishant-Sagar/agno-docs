description: Learn how to run an agent and get the response.
---

The `Agent.run()` function runs the agent and generates a response, either as a `RunOutput` object or a stream of `RunOutputEvent` objects.

<Note>
  Many of our examples use `agent.print_response()` which is a helper utility to
  print the response in the terminal. It uses `agent.run()` under the hood.
</Note>

## Running Agents

Here's how to run your agent. The response is captured in the `response`.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent, RunOutput
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"))

# Run agent and return the response as a variable
response: RunOutput = agent.run("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot")

# Print the response in markdown format
pprint_run_response(response, markdown=True)
```

### Typed inputs and outputs

An agent can be provided with typed input (i.e a pydantic model) by passing it in the `Agent.run()` or `Agent.print_response()` as the `input` parameter.

```python
from typing import List

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class ResearchTopic(BaseModel):
    """Structured research topic with specific requirements"""

    topic: str
    focus_areas: List[str] = Field(description="Specific areas to focus on")
    target_audience: str = Field(description="Who this research is for")
    sources_required: int = Field(description="Number of sources needed", default=5)

hackernews_agent = Agent(
    name="Hackernews Agent",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-nano"),
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
    role="Extract key insights and content from Hackernews posts",
)

hackernews_agent.print_response(
    input=ResearchTopic(
        topic="AI",
        focus_areas=["AI", "Machine Learning"],
        target_audience="Developers",
        sources_required=5,
    )
)
```

<Tip>
You can set the `input_schema` on the agent to validate the input. See more details in the [Input and Output](/concepts/agents/input-output) documentation.
</Tip>

In addition, you can set the `output_schema` on the agent to specify typed output.

```python hackernews_agent.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools

class HackernewsReport(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(..., description="Title of the Hackernews article.")
    subtitle: str = Field(..., description="Subtitle of the Hackernews article.")
    content: str = Field(..., description="Content of the Hackernews article.")

hackernews_agent = Agent(
    name="Hackernews Agent",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-nano"),
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
    role="Extract key insights and content from Hackernews posts and write a report about it.",
    output_schema=HackernewsReport,
)

hackernews_agent.print_response("Latest happening in the world of AI")
```

### RunOutput

The `Agent.run()` function returns a `RunOutput` object when not streaming. Here are some of the core attributes:

- `run_id`: The id of the run.
- `agent_id`: The id of the agent.
- `agent_name`: The name of the agent.
- `session_id`: The id of the session.
- `user_id`: The id of the user.
- `content`: The response content.
- `content_type`: The type of content. In the case of structured output, this will be the class name of the pydantic model.
- `reasoning_content`: The reasoning content.
- `messages`: The list of messages sent to the model.
- `metrics`: The metrics of the run. For more details see [Metrics](/concepts/agents/metrics).
- `model`: The model used for the run.

See detailed documentation in the [RunOutput](/reference/agents/run-response) documentation.

## Streaming Responses

To enable streaming, set `stream=True` when calling `run()`. This will return an iterator of `RunOutputEvent` objects instead of a single response.

```python
from typing import Iterator
from agno.agent import Agent, RunOutputEvent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4-mini"))

# Run agent and return the response as a stream
response_stream: Iterator[RunOutputEvent] = agent.run(
    "Tell me a 5 second short story about a lion",
    stream=True
)

# Print the response stream in markdown format
pprint_run_response(response_stream, markdown=True)
```

### Streaming Intermediate Steps

For even more detailed streaming, you can enable intermediate steps by setting `stream_intermediate_steps=True`. This will provide real-time updates about the agent's internal processes.

```python
# Stream with intermediate steps
response_stream: Iterator[RunOutputEvent] = agent.run(
    "Tell me a 5 second short story about a lion",
    stream=True,
    stream_intermediate_steps=True
)
```

### Handling Events

You can process events as they arrive by iterating over the response stream:

```python
response_stream = agent.run("Tell me a 5 second short story about a lion", stream=True, stream_intermediate_steps=True)

for event in response_stream:
    if event.event == "RunContent":
        print(f"Content: {event.content}")
    elif event.event == "ToolCallStarted":
        print(f"Tool call started: {event.tool}")
    elif event.event == "ReasoningStep":
        print(f"Reasoning step: {event.content}")
    ...
```

You can see this behavior in action in the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com/chat/agents).

### Storing Events

You can store all the events that happened during a run on the `RunOutput` object.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"), store_events=True)

response = agent.run("Tell me a 5 second short story about a lion", stream=True, stream_intermediate_steps=True)
pprint_run_response(response)

for event in response.events:
    print(event.event)
```

By default the `RunContentEvent` event is not stored (because it would be very verbose). You can modify which events are skipped by setting the `events_to_skip` parameter.

For example:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.run.agent import RunEvent

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"), store_events=True, events_to_skip=[RunEvent.run_started])
```

### Event Types

The following events are yielded by the `Agent.run()` and `Agent.arun()` functions depending on the agent's configuration:
