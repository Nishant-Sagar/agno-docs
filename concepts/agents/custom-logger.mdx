description: Learn how to use custom loggers in your Agno setup.

You can provide your own loggers to Agno, to be used instead of the default ones.

This can be useful if you need your system to log in any specific format.

## Example

```python
import logging

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.utils.log import configure_agno_logging, log_info


def get_custom_logger():
    """Return an example custom logger."""
    custom_logger = logging.getLogger("custom_logger")
    handler = logging.StreamHandler()
    formatter = logging.Formatter("[CUSTOM_LOGGER] %(levelname)s: %(message)s")
    handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    custom_logger.addHandler(handler)
    custom_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)  # Set level to INFO to show info messages
    custom_logger.propagate = False
    return custom_logger


# Get the custom logger we will use for the example.
custom_logger = get_custom_logger()

# Configure Agno to use our custom logger. It will be used for all logging.
configure_agno_logging(custom_default_logger=custom_logger)

# Every use of the logging function in agno.utils.log will now use our custom logger.
log_info("This is using our custom logger!")

# Now let's setup an Agent and run it.
# All logging coming from the Agent will use our custom logger.
agent = Agent()
agent.print_response("What can I do to improve my sleep?")
```

## Multiple Loggers

Notice that you can also configure different loggers for your Agents, Teams and Workflows:

```python
configure_agno_logging(
    custom_default_logger=custom_agent_logger,
    custom_agent_logger=custom_agent_logger,
    custom_team_logger=custom_team_logger,
    custom_workflow_logger=custom_workflow_logger,
)
```

## Using Named Loggers

As it's conventional in Python, you can also provide custom loggers just by setting loggers with specific names. This is useful if you want to set them up using configuration files.

- `agno.agent` will be used for all Agent logs
- `agno.team` will be used for all Team logs
- `agno.workflow` will be used for all Workflow logs

These loggers will be automatically picked up if they are set.
