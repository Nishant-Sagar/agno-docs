**Agents** at Agno are the building blocks of your agentic system. They are autonomous AI programs that dynamically determine their course of action using a **large language model** (LLM).

The core components of an Agent are:

- **Model:** The LLM that controls the flow of execution. It decides whether to reason, act or respond.
- **Instructions:** How we program the Agent, teaching it how to use tools and respond. This forms part of the "context" of the Agent.
- **Tools:** Enable an Agent to take actions and interact with external systems.
- **Reasoning:** Enables Agents to "think" before responding and "analyze" the results of their actions (i.e. tool calls), this improves reliability and quality of responses.
- **Knowledge:** Domain-specific information that the Agent can **search at runtime** to make better decisions and provide accurate responses (Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG). 
- **Storage:** Used by Agents to save session history and state in a database. Model APIs are stateless and storage enables us to continue conversations from where they left off. This enables multi-turn, long-term conversations with Agents.
- **Memory:** Gives Agents the ability to store and recall information from previous interactions, allowing them to learn user preferences and personalize their responses.
