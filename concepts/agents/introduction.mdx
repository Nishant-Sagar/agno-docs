**Agents** at Agno are the building blocks of your agentic system. They are autonomous AI programs that dynamically determine their course of action using a **large language model**.

The core components of an Agent are:

- **Model:** controls the flow of execution. It decides whether to reason, act or respond.
- **Instructions:** are how we program the Agent, teaching it how to use tools and respond.
- **Tools:** enable an Agent to take actions and interact with external systems.
- **Reasoning:** enables Agents to "think" before responding and "analyze" the results of their actions (i.e. tool calls), this improves reliability and quality of responses.
- **Knowledge:** is domain-specific information that the Agent can **search at runtime** to make better decisions and provide accurate responses (Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG). Knowledge is stored in a vector database and this **search at runtime** pattern is known as Agentic RAG/Agentic Search.
- **Storage:** is used by Agents to save session history and state in a database. Model APIs are stateless and storage enables us to continue conversations from where they left off. This makes Agents stateful, enabling multi-turn, long-term conversations.
- **Memory:** gives Agents the ability to store and recall information from previous interactions, allowing them to learn user preferences and personalize their responses.
