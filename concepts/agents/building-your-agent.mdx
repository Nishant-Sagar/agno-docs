When building an Agent, it is important to consider the following:
- **Which model to use?** -> See the [Models](/concepts/models/introduction) documentation.
- **Which tools to use?** -> See the [Tools](/concepts/agents/tools) documentation.
- **Which instructions to use?** -> See the [Context Engineering](/concepts/agents/context) documentation.
- **Should I enable reasoning?** -> See the [Reasoning](/concepts/reasoning) documentation.
- **Do I need to add knowledge?** -> See the [Knowledge](/concepts/agents/knowledge) documentation.
- **How do I configure storage?** -> See the [Storage](/concepts/agents/storage) documentation.
- **How do I configure memory?** -> See the [Memory](/concepts/agents/memory) documentation.

## The Development Process

It is typical while developing an Agent to use the `Agent.print_response()` method to print the response in the terminal. This is only for convenience during development and not recommended for production use.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"))

agent.print_response("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot")

# Or for streaming
agent.print_response("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot", stream=True)

# Or async
await agent.aprint_response("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot")

# Or for async streaming
await agent.aprint_response("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot", stream=True)
```

<Note>
The `Agent.print_response()` and `Agent.aprint_response()` methods are helper methods that use the `Agent.run()` and `Agent.arun()` methods under the hood. 

See [Running your Agent](/concepts/agents/running-your-agent) for more details.
</Note>

See the full method signature in the [Agent class reference](/reference/agents/agent#print_response).

## Debugging

You can enable debug mode to get more detailed logs.

```python
agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"), debug_mode=True)

# You can also set it directly on the run
agent.print_response("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot", debug_mode=True)
```

## Interactive CLI 

You can also interact with the agent via a CLI.

```python
agent.cli_app(input="Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot", stream=True)
```

See the [Agent class reference](/reference/agents/agent) for more details.
