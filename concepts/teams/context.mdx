Context engineering is the process of designing and controlling the information (context) that is sent to language models to guide their behavior and outputs. 
In Agno, this means carefully crafting the system message, which includes the team's description, instructions, and other relevant settings. By thoughtfully engineering this context, you can:

- Steer the team toward specific behaviors or roles.
- Constrain or expand the team's capabilities.
- Ensure outputs are consistent, relevant, and aligned with your application's needs.
- Enable advanced use cases such as multi-step reasoning, tool use, or structured output for your team.

Effective context engineering involves iteratively refining the system message, experimenting with different descriptions and instructions, and leveraging features like input/output schemas or tool integrations. 

The context of an Agno team consists of the following:
- **System message**: The system message is the main context that is sent to the team, including all additional context
- **User message**: The user message is the message that is sent to the team.
- **Chat history**: The chat history is the history of the conversation between the team and the user.
- **Additional input**: Any few-shot examples or other additional input that is added to the context.

See [Agent Context Engineering](/concepts/agents/context) for more information.

## System message context

The following are some key parameters that are used to create the system message:

1. **Description**: A description that guides the overall behaviour of the agent.
2. **Instructions**: A list of precise, task-specific instructions on how to achieve its goal.
3. **Expected Output**: A description of the expected output from the Agent.

The system message is created using `description`, `instructions` and a number of other settings. The `description` is added to the start of the system message and `instructions` are added as a list. For example:

```python instructions.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.team import Team
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools

web_agent = Agent(
    name="Web Researcher",
    role="You are a web researcher that can find information on the web.",
    instructions=[
        "Use your web search tool to find information on the web.",
        "Provide a summary of the information found.",
    ],
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    markdown=True,
    debug_mode=True,  # Set to True to view the detailed logs
)
hackernews_agent = Agent(
    name="HackerNews Researcher",
    role="You are a hackernews researcher that can find information on hackernews.",
    instructions=[
        "Use your hackernews search tool to find information on hackernews.",
        "Provide a summary of the information found.",
    ],
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
    markdown=True,
    debug_mode=True,  # Set to True to view the detailed logs
)

team = Team(
    members=[web_agent, hackernews_agent],
    instructions=[
        "You are a team of researchers that can find information on the web and hackernews.",
        "After finding information about the topic, compile a joint report."
    ],
    markdown=True,
    debug_mode=True,   # Set to True to view the detailed logs and see the compiled system message
)
team.print_response("What is the latest news on the crypto market?", stream=True)
```

Will produce the following system message:

```
You are the leader of a team and sub-teams of AI Agents.
Your task is to coordinate the team to complete the user's request.

Here are the members in your team:
<team_members>
- Agent 1:
    - ID: web-researcher
    - Name: Web Researcher
    - Role: You are a web researcher that can find information on the web.
    - Member tools:
        - duckduckgo_search
        - duckduckgo_news
- Agent 2:
    - ID: hacker-news-researcher
    - Name: HackerNews Researcher
    - Role: You are a hackernews researcher that can find information on hackernews.
    - Member tools:
        - get_top_hackernews_stories
        - get_user_details
</team_members>

<how_to_respond>
- Your role is to forward tasks to members in your team with the highest likelihood of completing the user's request.
- Carefully analyze the tools available to the members and their roles before delegating tasks.
- You cannot use a member tool directly. You can only delegate tasks to members.
- When you delegate a task to another member, make sure to include:
    - member_id (str): The ID of the member to delegate the task to. Use only the ID of the member, not the ID of the team followed by the ID of the
member.
    - task_description (str): A clear description of the task.
    - expected_output (str): The expected output.
- You can delegate tasks to multiple members at once.
- You must always analyze the responses from members before responding to the user.
- After analyzing the responses from the members, if you feel the task has been completed, you can stop and respond to the user.
- If you are not satisfied with the responses from the members, you should re-assign the task.
- For simple greetings, thanks, or questions about the team itself, you should respond directly.
- For all work requests, tasks, or questions requiring expertise, route to appropriate team members.
</how_to_respond>

<instructions>
- You are a team of researchers that can find information on the web and hackernews.
- After finding information about the topic, compile a joint report.
</instructions>

<additional_information>
- Use markdown to format your answers.
</additional_information>
```

### Additional Context

You can add additional context to the end of the system message using the `additional_context` parameter.

In this example, we add additional context to the system message that the agent has access to specific tables in a database.

```python
from textwrap import dedent

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.team import Team
from agno.models.langdb import LangDB
from agno.tools.duckdb import DuckDbTools
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

duckdb_tools = DuckDbTools(
    create_tables=False, export_tables=False, summarize_tables=False
)
duckdb_tools.create_table_from_path(
    path="https://phidata-public.s3.amazonaws.com/demo_data/IMDB-Movie-Data.csv",
    table="movies",
)

web_researcher = Agent(
    name="Web Researcher",
    role="You are a web researcher that can find information on the web.",
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions=[
        "Use your web search tool to find information on the web.",
        "Provide a summary of the information found.",
    ],
)

team = Team(
    members=[web_researcher],
    model=LangDB(id="llama3-1-70b-instruct-v1.0"),
    tools=[duckdb_tools],
    markdown=True,
    additional_context=dedent("""\
    You have access to the following tables:
    - movies: contains information about movies from IMDB.
    """),
)
team.print_response("What is the average rating of movies?", stream=True)
```

### System message Parameters

The Team leader creates a default system message that can be customized using the following parameters:

| Parameter                        | Type        | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description`                    | `str`       | `None`  | A description of the Team that is added to the start of the system message.                                                                                                |
| `instructions`                   | `List[str]` | `None`  | List of instructions added to the system prompt in `<instructions>` tags. Default instructions are also created depending on values for `markdown`, `expected_output` etc. |
| `additional_context`             | `str`       | `None`  | Additional context added to the end of the system message.                                                                                                                 |
| `expected_output`                | `str`       | `None`  | Provide the expected output from the Team. This is added to the end of the system message.                                                                                 |
| `markdown`                       | `bool`      | `False` | Add an instruction to format the output using markdown.                                                                                                                    |
| `add_datetime_to_context`        | `bool`      | `False` | If True, add the current datetime to the prompt to give the team a sense of time. This allows for relative times like "tomorrow" to be used in the prompt                  |
| `add_name_to_context`            | `bool`      | `False` | If True, add the name of the team to the context.                                                                                                                          |
| `add_location_to_context`        | `bool`      | `False` | If True, add the location of the team to the context. This allows for location-aware responses and local context.                                                          |
| `add_session_summary_to_context` | `bool`      | `False` | If True, add the session summary to the context. See [sessions](/concepts/teams/sessions) for more information.                                                           |
| `add_memories_to_context`        | `bool`      | `False` | If True, add the user memories to the context. See [memory](/concepts/teams/memory) for more information.                                                                 |
| `add_dependencies_to_context`    | `bool`      | `False` | If True, add the dependencies to the context. See [dependencies](/concepts/teams/dependencies) for more information.                                                      |
| `add_session_state_to_context`   | `bool`      | `False` | If True, add the session state to the context. See [state](/concepts/teams/state) for more information.                                                                   |
| `add_knowledge_to_context`       | `bool`      | `False` | If True, add retrieved knowledge to the context, to enable RAG. See [knowledge](/concepts/teams/knowledge) for more information.                                          |
| `system_message`                 | `str`       | `None`  | Override the default system message.                                                                                                                                       |

See the full [Team reference](/reference/teams/team) for more information.

### Set the system message directly

You can manually set the system message using the `system_message` parameter. This will ignore all other settings and use the system message you provide.

```python
from agno.team import Team

team = Team(members=[], system_message="Share a 2 sentence story about")
team.print_response("Love in the year 12000.")
```

## User message

The `input` sent to the `Team.run()` or `Team.print_response()` is used as the user message.

See [dependencies](/concepts/teams/dependencies) for how to do dependency injection for your user message.

## Chat history

If you have database storage enabled on your team, session history is automatically stored (see [sessions](/concepts/teams/sessions)).

You can now add the history of the conversation to the context using `add_history_to_context`.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.team import Team
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.db.postgres import PostgresDb
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

db_url = "postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai"

db = PostgresDb(db_url=db_url)

web_researcher = Agent(
    name="Web Researcher",
    role="You are a web researcher that can find information on the web.",
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions=[
        "Use your web search tool to find information on the web.",
        "Provide a summary of the information found.",
    ],
)

team = Team(
    members=[web_researcher],
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    db=db,
    session_id="chat_history",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant that can answer questions about space and oceans.",
    add_history_to_context=True,
    num_history_runs=2,  # Optionally limit the number of history responses to add to the context
)

team.print_response("Where is the sea of tranquility?")

team.print_response("What was my first question?")
```

This will add the history of the conversation to the context, which can be used to provide context for the next message.

See more details on [sessions](/concepts/teams/sessions#session-history).

<Note>All team member runs are added to the team session history.</Note>

## Additional input

You can add entire additional messages to your team's context using the `additional_input` parameter.
These messages are added to the context as if they were part of the conversation history.

You can give your team examples of how it should respond (also called "few-shot prompting"):

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.models.message import Message
from agno.models.openai.chat import OpenAIChat

# Few-shot examples showing good support patterns
support_examples = [
    # Example 1: Simple issue resolution
    Message(role="user", content="I forgot my password and can't log in"),
    Message(
        role="assistant",
        content="""
    I'll help you reset your password right away.

    **Steps to Reset Your Password:**
    . Go to the login page and click "Forgot Password"
    . Enter your email address
    . Check your email for the reset link
    . Follow the link to create a new password
    . Use a strong password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

    f you don't receive the email within 5 minutes, please check your spam folder. Let me know if you need any assistance with these steps!
    """.strip(),
    ),
    # Example 2: Billing issue pattern
    Message(
        role="user",
        content="I've been charged twice for the same order and I'm frustrated!",
    ),
    Message(
        role="assistant",
        content="""
    I sincerely apologize for the billing error and the frustration this has caused you.

    **Immediate Action Plan:**
    1. I'll investigate your account to confirm the duplicate charge
    2. Process a full refund for the duplicate transaction
    3. Ensure this doesn't happen again by checking your payment method settings
    4. Provide you with a confirmation number once the refund is processed

    The refund typically takes 3-5 business days to appear on your statement. As an apology for this inconvenience, I'd also like to offer you a 10% discount on your next order.

    Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this issue?
    """.strip(),
    ),
    # Example 3: Technical support pattern
    Message(role="user", content="Your app keeps crashing when I try to upload photos"),
    Message(
        role="assistant",
        content="""
    I'm sorry you're experiencing crashes with photo uploads. Let me help you troubleshoot this issue.

    **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    1. **Check App Version:** Ensure you have the latest version from the app store
    2. **Restart the App:** Close completely and reopen the application
    3. **Check Storage:** Make sure you have sufficient device storage (at least 1GB free)
    4. **Photo Size:** Try uploading smaller photos (under 10MB each)
    5. **Network Connection:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection

    **If the issue persists:**
    - Try uploading one photo at a time instead of multiple
    - Clear the app cache in your device settings
    - Restart your device

    If none of these steps resolve the issue, please let me know your device type and OS version, and I'll escalate this to our technical team for further investigation.
