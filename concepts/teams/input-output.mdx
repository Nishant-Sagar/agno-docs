Agno Teams support various forms of input and output.


The most standard pattern is to use `str` input and `str` output.

```python
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.team import Team

team = Team(
    members=[],
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    description="You write movie scripts.",
)

response = team.run("Write movie script about a girl living in New York")
print(response.content)
```

## Structured Output

Teams can be used to generate structured data (i.e. a pydantic model). This is generally called "Structured Output".
Use this feature to extract features, classify data, produce fake data etc. The best part is that they work with function calls, knowledge bases and all other features.

Let's create an Movie Agent to write a `MovieScript` for us.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Structured Output example">
    ```python structured_output_team.py
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
    from agno.team import Team
    from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
    from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response


    class StockAnalysis(BaseModel):
        symbol: str
        company_name: str
        analysis: str

    class CompanyAnalysis(BaseModel):
        company_name: str
        analysis: str

    stock_searcher = Agent(
        name="Stock Searcher",
        model=OpenAIChat("gpt-5-mini"),
        output_schema=StockAnalysis,
        role="Searches for information on stocks and provides price analysis.",
        tools=[
            DuckDuckGoTools()
        ],
    )

    company_info_agent = Agent(
        name="Company Info Searcher",
        model=OpenAIChat("gpt-5-mini"),
        role="Searches for information about companies and recent news.",
        output_schema=CompanyAnalysis,
        tools=[
            DuckDuckGoTools()
        ],
    )

    class StockReport(BaseModel):
        symbol: str
        company_name: str
        analysis: str

    team = Team(
        name="Stock Research Team",
        model=OpenAIChat("gpt-5-mini"),
        members=[stock_searcher, company_info_agent],
        output_schema=StockReport,
        markdown=True,
    )

    # This should route to the stock_searcher
    response = team.run("What is the current stock price of NVDA?")
    assert isinstance(response.content, StockReport)
    pprint_run_response(response)
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the example">
    Install libraries

    ```shell
    pip install openai agno ddgs
    ```

    Export your key
    ```shell
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx
    ```

    Run the example

    ```shell
    python structured_output_team.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

The output is an object of the `StockReport` class, here's how it looks:

```python
StockReport(
│   "symbol": "NVDA",                                                                                                                                     │
│   "company_name": "NVIDIA Corp",                                                                                                                        │
│   "analysis": "NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) remains a leading player in the AI chip market, ..."
)
```

<Tip>
  Some LLMs are not able to generate structured output. Agno has an option to tell the model to respond as JSON. Although this is typically not as accurate as structured output, it can be useful in some cases.
  
  If you want to use JSON mode, you can set `use_json_mode=True` on the Agent.

  ```python
  team = Team(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    members=[stock_searcher, company_info_agent],
    description="You write stock reports.",
    output_schema=StockReport,
    use_json_mode=True,
  )
  ```
</Tip>


### Streaming Structured Output

Streaming can be used in combination with `output_schema`. This returns the structured output as a single `RunContent` event in the stream of events.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Streaming Structured Output example">
        ```python streaming_structured_output_team.py
        import asyncio
        from typing import Dict, List

        from agno.agent import Agent
        from agno.models.openai.chat import OpenAIChat
        from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


        class MovieScript(BaseModel):
            setting: str = Field(
                ..., description="Provide a nice setting for a blockbuster movie."
            )
            ending: str = Field(
                ...,
                description="Ending of the movie. If not available, provide a happy ending.",
            )
            genre: str = Field(
                ...,
                description="Genre of the movie. If not available, select action, thriller or romantic comedy.",
            )
            name: str = Field(..., description="Give a name to this movie")
            characters: List[str] = Field(..., description="Name of characters for this movie.")
            storyline: str = Field(
                ..., description="3 sentence storyline for the movie. Make it exciting!"
            )
            rating: Dict[str, int] = Field(
                ...,
                description="Your own rating of the movie. 1-10. Return a dictionary with the keys 'story' and 'acting'.",
            )


        # Agent that uses structured outputs with streaming
        structured_output_team = Team(
            members=[],
            model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
            description="You write movie scripts.",
            output_schema=MovieScript,
        )

        structured_output_team.print_response(
            "New York", stream=True, stream_intermediate_steps=True
        )
        ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the example">
    Install libraries

    ```shell
    pip install openai agno ddgs
    ```

    Export your key
    ```shell
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx
    ```

    Run the example

    ```shell
    python streaming_structured_output_team.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Structured Input

A team can be provided with structured input (i.e a pydantic model) by passing it in the `Team.run()` or `Team.print_response()` as the `input` parameter.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Structured Input example">
    ```python structured_input_team.py
    from typing import List

        depth_level: str = Field(
            description="Research depth level", pattern="^(basic|intermediate|advanced)$"
        )
        max_sources: int = Field(
            description="Maximum number of sources to use", ge=3, le=20, default=10
        )
        include_recent_only: bool = Field(
            description="Whether to focus only on recent sources", default=True
        )


    # Create research agents
    hackernews_agent = Agent(
        name="HackerNews Researcher",

        ],
    )

    web_researcher = Agent(
        name="Web Researcher",
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
        tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
        role="Conduct comprehensive web research",
        instructions=[

        include_recent_only=False,
    )

    research_team.print_response(input=research_request)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the example">
    Install libraries

    ```shell
    pip install openai agno ddgs

    Run the example

    ```shell
    python structured_input_team.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Validating the input

You can set `input_schema` on the Team to validate the input.  If you then pass the input as a dictionary, it will be automatically validated against the schema.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Validating the input example">
        ```python validating_input_team.py
        from typing import List

        from agno.agent import Agent
        from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
        from agno.team.team import Team

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Typesafe Teams

A **typesafe team** is one that uses both `input_schema` and `output_schema` to ensure complete type safety throughout the entire data pipeline. This creates a fully validated interface where both inputs and outputs are guaranteed to follow specific structures.

Typesafe teams provide:

- Input validation using `input_schema` 
- Output structure guarantee using `output_schema`
- Runtime type checking for both directions
- Production reliability with predictable interfaces

### Complete Typesafe Research Team

Here's a comprehensive example showing a fully typesafe team for research tasks:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the typesafe research team">
    ```python typesafe_research_team.py
    from typing import List

    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
    from agno.team import Team
    from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools
    from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
    from rich.pretty import pprint


    # Define your input schema
    class ResearchTopic(BaseModel):
        topic: str
        sources_required: int = Field(description="Number of sources", default=5)


    # Define your output schema
    class ResearchOutput(BaseModel):
        summary: str = Field(..., description="Executive summary of the research")
        insights: List[str] = Field(..., description="Key insights from posts")
        top_stories: List[str] = Field(
            ..., description="Most relevant and popular stories found"
        )
        technologies: List[str] = Field(
            ..., description="Technologies mentioned"
        )
        sources: List[str] = Field(..., description="Links to the most relevant posts")


    # Define your agents
    hn_researcher_agent = Agent(
        name="HackerNews Researcher",
        model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-0"),
        tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
        role="Research hackernews posts for a given topic",
    )

    web_researcher_agent = Agent(
        name="Web Researcher",
        model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-0"),
        tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
        role="Research web content for additional context",
    )

    # Define your team
    hn_researcher_team = Team(
        # Model to use
        model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-0"),
        # Team members
        members=[hn_researcher_agent, web_researcher_agent],
        instructions="Research topics by coordinating between HackerNews and web research",
        # Add your input schema
        input_schema=ResearchTopic,
        # Add your output schema
        output_schema=ResearchOutput,
        # Model to use convert the output to the JSON schema
        parser_model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-nano"),
    )

    # Run the Team
    response = hn_researcher_team.run(
        input=ResearchTopic(topic="AI", sources_required=5)
    )

    # Print the response
    pprint(response.content)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the team">
    Install libraries

    ```shell
    pip install agno openai anthropic ddgs
    ```

    Set your API keys
    ```shell
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=xxx
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx
    ```

    Run the team
    ```shell
    python typesafe_research_team.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

The output is a structured `ResearchOutput` object:

```python
ResearchOutput(
    summary='AI development is accelerating with new breakthroughs in...',
    insights=['LLMs are becoming more efficient', 'Open source models gaining traction'],
    top_stories=['GPT-5 rumors surface', 'New Claude model released'],
    technologies=['GPT-4', 'Claude', 'Transformers'],
    sources=['https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=123', '...']
)
```

### Production Benefits

With both input and output schemas defined, you eliminate common integration issues:

```python
# Without type safety - prone to errors
regular_team = Team(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    members=[...],
    description="Analyze sentiment"
)
response = regular_team.run("analyze this text")  # What format will we get back?
sentiment = response.content  # String? Dict? Unknown structure?

# With type safety - Better assurance of getting the right response
typesafe_team = Team(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    members=[...],
    description="Analyze sentiment",
    input_schema=ResearchTopic,
    output_schema=ResearchOutput,
)
response = typesafe_team.run(input=ResearchTopic(topic="AI", sources_required=5))
summary = response.content.summary  # Guaranteed to be a string
```

Typesafe teams are especially valuable in production systems where you need guaranteed data contracts between your application and AI teams.

## Using a Parser Model

You can use a different model to parse and structure the output from your primary model. 
This approach is particularly effective when the primary model is optimized for reasoning tasks, as such models may not consistently produce detailed structured responses.

```python
team = Team(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),  # The main processing model
    members=[...],
    description="You write movie scripts.",
    output_schema=MovieScript,
    parser_model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),  # Only used to parse the output
)
```

You can also provide a custom `parser_model_prompt` to your Parser Model to customize the model's instructions.

### Using an Output Model

You can use a different model to produce the run output of the team.
This is useful when the primary model is optimized for image analysis, for example, but you want a different model to produce a structured output response.

```python
team = Team(
    model=Gemini(id="gemini-2.0-flash-001"),  # The main processing model
    description="You write movie scripts.",
    output_schema=MovieScript,
    output_model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),  # Only used to parse the output
    members=[...],
)
```

You can also provide a custom `output_model_prompt` to your Output Model to customize the model's instructions.

<Tip>
  Gemini models often reject requests to use tools and produce structured output
  at the same time. Using an Output Model is an effective workaround for this.
