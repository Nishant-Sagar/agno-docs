The PII Detection Guardrail is a built-in guardrail you can use detect PII (Personally Identifiable Information) in the input of your Teams.

This is useful for applications where you don't want to allow PII to be sent to the LLM.

## Basic Usage

To provide your Team with the PII Detection Guardrail, you need to import it and pass it to the Team using the `pre_hooks` parameter:

```python
from agno.guardrails import PIIDetectionGuardrail
from agno.team import Team
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

team = Team(
    name="Privacy-Protected Team",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    pre_hooks=[PIIDetectionGuardrail()],
)
```

## PII fields

The default list of PII fields handled by the guardrail are:

- Social Security Numbers (SSNs)
- Credit Card Numbers
- Email Addresses
- Phone Numbers

You can also select which specific fields you want to detect. For example, we can disable the Email check by doing this:

```python
guardrail = PIIDetectionGuardrail(
    enable_email_check=False,
)
```

## Custom PII fields

You can also extend the list of PII fields handled by the guardrail by adding your own own custom PII patterns.

For example, we can add a custom PII pattern for bank account numbers:

```python
guardrail = PIIDetectionGuardrail(
    pii_patterns={
        "bank_account_number": r"\b\d{10}\b",
    }
)
```

Notice that providing custom PII patterns via the `pii_patterns` parameter will override the default list of PII fields. Only the provided custom patterns will be used.

## Masking PII

By default, the PII Detection Guardrail will raise an error if it detects any PII in the input.

However, you can mask the PII in the input instead of raising, by setting the `mask_pii` parameter to `True`:

```python
guardrail = PIIDetectionGuardrail(
    mask_pii=True,
)
```

This will mask all the PII in the input with asterisk characters. For example, if you are checking for emails, the string `joe@example.com`, will be masked as `**************`.
