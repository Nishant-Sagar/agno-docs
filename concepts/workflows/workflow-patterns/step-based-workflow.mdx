description: Named steps for better logging and support on the AgentOS chat page

**You can name your steps** for better logging and future support on the Agno platform.
This also changes the name of a step when accessing that step's output inside a `StepInput` object.

#### Parameters

<Snippet file="step-reference.mdx" />

#### Example

```python
from agno.workflow import Step, Workflow

# Named steps for better tracking
workflow = Workflow(
    name="Content Creation Pipeline",
    steps=[
        Step(name="Research Phase", team=researcher),
        Step(name="Analysis Phase", executor=custom_function),
        Step(name="Writing Phase", agent=writer),
    ]
)

workflow.print_response(
    "AI trends in 2024",
    markdown=True,
)
```
