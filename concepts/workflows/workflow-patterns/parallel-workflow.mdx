title: Parallel Workflow
description: Independent, concurrent tasks that can execute simultaneously for improved efficiency
---

**Example Use-Cases**: Multi-source research, parallel analysis, concurrent data processing

Parallel workflows maintain deterministic results while dramatically reducing execution time for independent operations.

## Example

```python parallel_workflow.py
from agno.workflow import Parallel, Step, Workflow

workflow = Workflow(
    name="Parallel Research Pipeline",
    steps=[
        Parallel(
            Step(name="HackerNews Research", agent=hn_researcher),
            Step(name="Web Research", agent=web_researcher),
            Step(name="Academic Research", agent=academic_researcher),
            name="Research Step"
        ),
        Step(name="Synthesis", agent=synthesizer),  # Combines the results and produces a report
    ]
)

workflow.print_response("Write about the latest AI developments", markdown=True)
