description: How to store events in workflows
---

Workflows can automatically store all execution events for analysis, debugging, and audit purposes. Filter specific event types to reduce noise and storage overhead while maintaining essential execution records.

Access stored events via `workflow.run_response.events` and in the `runs` column of your workflow's session database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.).

- `store_events=True`: Automatically stores all workflow events in the database
- `events_to_skip=[]`: Filter out specific event types to reduce storage and noise

Access all stored events via `workflow.run_response.events`

**Available Events to Skip:**
```python
from agno.run.workflow import WorkflowRunEvent

# Common events you might want to skip
events_to_skip = [
    WorkflowRunEvent.workflow_started,
    WorkflowRunEvent.workflow_completed,
    WorkflowRunEvent.workflow_cancelled,
    WorkflowRunEvent.step_started,
    WorkflowRunEvent.step_completed,
    WorkflowRunEvent.parallel_execution_started,
    WorkflowRunEvent.parallel_execution_completed,
    WorkflowRunEvent.condition_execution_started,
    WorkflowRunEvent.condition_execution_completed,
    WorkflowRunEvent.loop_execution_started,
    WorkflowRunEvent.loop_execution_completed,
    WorkflowRunEvent.router_execution_started,
    WorkflowRunEvent.router_execution_completed,
]
```

**Use Cases**
- **Debugging**: Store all events to analyze workflow execution flow
- **Audit Trails**: Keep records of all workflow activities for compliance
- **Performance Analysis**: Analyze timing and execution patterns
- **Error Investigation**: Review event sequences leading to failures
- **Noise Reduction**: Skip verbose events like `step_started` to focus on results

**Configuration Examples**
```python
# store everything
debug_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Debug Workflow",
    store_events=True,
    steps=[...]
)

# store only important events
production_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Production Workflow", 
    store_events=True,
    events_to_skip=[
        WorkflowRunEvent.step_started,
        WorkflowRunEvent.parallel_execution_started,
        # keep step_completed and workflow_completed
    ],
    steps=[...]
)

# No event storage
fast_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Fast Workflow",
    store_events=False,  
    steps=[...]
)
```
