Nexus is a routing platform that provides endpoints for various Large Language Models through a unified API interface.

Explore Nexus's capabilities and documentation [here](https://nexusrouter.com/).

## Authentication

Nexus requires API keys for the underlying model providers. Set the appropriate environment variables for the models you plan to use:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export OPENAI_API_KEY=***
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=***
```

```bash Windows
setx OPENAI_API_KEY ***
setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY ***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `Nexus` with your `Agent`:

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.nexus import Nexus

agent = Agent(model=Nexus(id="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"), markdown=True)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story")

```

</CodeGroup>
