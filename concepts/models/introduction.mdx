When we discuss Models, we are normally referring to Large Language Models (LLMs).

These models act as the **brain** of your Agents - enabling them to reason, act, and respond to the user. The better the model, the smarter the Agent.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    description="Share 15 minute healthy recipes.",
    markdown=True,
)
agent.print_response("Share a breakfast recipe.", stream=True)
```

## Error handling

You can set `exponential_backoff` to `True` on the `Agent` to automatically retry requests that fail due to third-party model provider errors.

```python
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    exponential_backoff=True,
    retries=2,
    retry_delay=1,
)
```
