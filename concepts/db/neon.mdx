Agno supports using [Neon](https://neon.com/) with the `PostgresDb` class.

You can get started with Neon following their [Get Started guide](https://neon.com/docs/get-started/signing-up).

You can also read more about the [`PostgresDb` class](/concepts/db/postgres) in its section.

## Usage

```python neon_for_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.postgres import PostgresDb
from os import getenv

# Get your Neon database URL
NEON_DB_URL = getenv("NEON_DB_URL")

# Setup the Neon database
db = PostgresDb(db_url=NEON_DB_URL)

# Setup your Agent with the Database
agent = Agent(db=db)
```
