title: What is Chunking?
sidebarTitle: Overview
description: Chunking is the process of breaking down large documents into smaller pieces for effective vector search and retrieval.
---

Chunking is the process of dividing content into manageable pieces before converting to embeddings and storing in vector databases. The chunking strategy you choose directly impacts search quality and retrieval accuracy.

Different chunking strategies serve different purposes:

<Accordion title="Example: Processing a Recipe Book" icon="book-open">
Different strategies produce different results:
- **Fixed Size**: Splits every 500 characters (may break recipes mid-instruction)
- **Semantic**: Keeps complete recipes together based on meaning
- **Document**: Each page becomes a chunk

The strategy affects whether you get complete, relevant results or fragmented pieces.

## Using Chunking Strategies

Chunking strategies are configured when setting up readers for your knowledge base:

```python
from agno.knowledge.chunking.semantic import SemanticChunking
from agno.knowledge.reader.pdf_reader import PDFReader
from agno.knowledge.knowledge import Knowledge
from agno.vectordb.pgvector import PgVector

# Configure chunking strategy with a reader
reader = PDFReader(
    chunking_strategy=SemanticChunking(similarity_threshold=0.7)
)

# Use with knowledge base
knowledge = Knowledge(
    vector_db=PgVector(table_name="documents", db_url="postgresql://..."),
)

# Add content with chunking applied
knowledge.add_content(
    path="documents/cookbook.pdf",
    reader=reader,
)
```

## Choosing a Strategy

The choice of chunking strategy depends on your content type and use case:

- **Text documents**: Semantic chunking maintains context and meaning
- **Structured documents**: Document or Markdown chunking preserves hierarchy  
- **Tabular data**: CSV Row chunking treats each row as a separate entity
- **Mixed content**: Recursive chunking provides flexibility with multiple separators
- **Uniform processing**: Fixed Size chunking ensures consistent chunk dimensions

<Tip>
Semantic chunking is recommended for most text-based content as it balances performance with context preservation.
