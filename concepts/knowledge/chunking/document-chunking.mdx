title: Document Chunking
---

Document chunking is a method of splitting documents into smaller chunks based on document structure like paragraphs and sections. It analyzes natural document boundaries rather than splitting at fixed character counts. This is useful when you want to process large documents while preserving semantic meaning and context.

## Usage

```python
import asyncio
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.knowledge.chunking.document import DocumentChunking
from agno.knowledge.knowledge import Knowledge
from agno.knowledge.reader.pdf_reader import PDFReader
from agno.vectordb.pgvector import PgVector

db_url = "postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai"

knowledge = Knowledge(
    vector_db=PgVector(table_name="recipes_document_chunking", db_url=db_url),
)

asyncio.run(knowledge.add_content_async(
    url="https://agno-public.s3.amazonaws.com/recipes/ThaiRecipes.pdf",
    reader=PDFReader(
        name="Document Chunking Reader",
        chunking_strategy=DocumentChunking(),
    ),
))

agent = Agent(
    knowledge=knowledge,
    search_knowledge=True,
)

agent.print_response("How to make Thai curry?", markdown=True)
```
