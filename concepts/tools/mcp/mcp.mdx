---

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) enables Agents to interact with external systems through a standardized interface.
You can connect your Agents to any MCP server, using Agno's MCP integration.

This simple example shows how to connect an Agent to the Agno MCP server:

```python agno_agent.py lines
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools

# Create the Agent
agno_agent = Agent(
    name="Agno Agent",
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-0"),
    # Add the Agno MCP server to the Agent
    tools=[MCPTools(transport="streamable-http", url="https://docs.agno.com/mcp")],
)
```

## Usage

<Steps>
    <Step title="Find the MCP server you want to use">
    You can use any working MCP server. To see some examples, you can check [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers), by the maintainers of the MCP themselves.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Initialize the MCP integration">
    Initialize the `MCPTools` class and connect to the MCP server. The recommended way to define the MCP server is to use the `command` or `url` parameters. With `command`, you can pass the command used to run the MCP server you want. With `url`, you can pass the URL of the running MCP server you want to use.


    For example, to connect to the Agno documentation MCP server, you can do the following:

    ```python
    from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools

    # Initialize and connect to the MCP server
    mcp_tools = MCPTools(transport="streamable-http", url="https://docs.agno.com/mcp"))
    await mcp_tools.connect()
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Provide the MCPTools to the Agent">
    When initializing the Agent, pass the `MCPTools` instance in the `tools` parameter. Remember to close the connection when you're done.


    The agent will now be ready to use the MCP server:


    ```python
    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
    from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools

    # Initialize and connect to the MCP server
    mcp_tools = MCPTools(url="https://docs.agno.com/mcp")
    await mcp_tools.connect()

    try:
        # Setup and run the agent
        agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"), tools=[mcp_tools])
        await agent.aprint_response("Tell me more about MCP support in Agno", stream=True)
    finally:
        # Always close the connection when done
        await mcp_tools.close()
    ```
    </Step>

</Steps>


### Example: Filesystem Agent

Here's a filesystem agent that uses the [Filesystem MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) to explore and analyze files:

```python filesystem_agent.py
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from textwrap import dedent

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools


async def run_agent(message: str) -> None:
    """Run the filesystem agent with the given message."""

    file_path = "<path to the directory you want to explore>"

    # Initialize and connect to the MCP server to access the filesystem
    mcp_tools = MCPTools(command=f"npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem {file_path}")
    await mcp_tools.connect()

    try:
        agent = Agent(
            model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
            tools=[mcp_tools],
            instructions=dedent("""\
                You are a filesystem assistant. Help users explore files and directories.

                - Navigate the filesystem to answer questions
                - Use the list_allowed_directories tool to find directories that you can access
                - Provide clear context about files you examine
                - Use headings to organize your responses
                - Be concise and focus on relevant information\
            """),
            markdown=True,
        )

        # Run the agent
        await agent.aprint_response(message, stream=True)
    finally:
        # Always close the connection when done
        await mcp_tools.close()


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Basic example - exploring project license
    asyncio.run(run_agent("What is the license for this project?"))
```

## Connecting your MCP server

### Using `connect()` and `close()`

You should use the `connect()` and `close()` methods to connect and disconnect from the MCP server.

This is the recommended way to setup your MCP server.

```python
mcp_tools = MCPTools(command="uvx mcp-server-git")
await mcp_tools.connect()
```

After you're done, you should close the connection to the MCP server.

```python
await mcp_tools.close()
```

### Using Async Context Manager

If you prefer, you can also use `MCPTools` or `MultiMCPTools` as async context managers for automatic resource cleanup:

```python
async with MCPTools(command="uvx mcp-server-git") as mcp_tools:
    agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"), tools=[mcp_tools])
    await agent.aprint_response("What is the license for this project?", stream=True)
```

This pattern automatically handles connection and cleanup, but the explicit `.connect()` and `.close()` methods provide more control over connection lifecycle.


## Transports

Transports in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) define how messages are sent and received. The Agno integration supports the three existing types:
- [stdio](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#standard-input%2Foutput-stdio) -> See the [stdio transport documentation](/concepts/tools/mcp/transports/stdio)
- [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/transports#streamable-http) -> See the [streamable HTTP transport documentation](/concepts/tools/mcp/transports/streamable_http)
- [SSE](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#server-sent-events-sse) -> See the [SSE transport documentation](/concepts/tools/mcp/transports/sse)

<Note>
The stdio (standard input/output) transport is the default one in Agno's `MCPTools` and `MultiMCPTools`. 
</Note>

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Cleanup**: Always close MCP connections when done to prevent resource leaks:
```python
mcp_tools = MCPTools(command="uvx mcp-server-git")
await mcp_tools.connect()

try:
    # Your agent code here
    pass
finally:
    await mcp_tools.close()
```

2. **Error Handling**: Always include proper error handling for MCP server connections and operations.

3. **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear and specific instructions to your agent:

```python
instructions = """
You are a filesystem assistant. Help users explore files and directories.
- Navigate the filesystem to answer questions
- Use the list_allowed_directories tool to find accessible directories
- Provide clear context about files you examine
- Be concise and focus on relevant information
"""
```
