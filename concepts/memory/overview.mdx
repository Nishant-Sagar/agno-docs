title: What is Memory?
description: Memory gives an Agent the ability to recall information about the user.

Using **Memory**, you can enable your Agents to recall information about the user.

When relevant information about the user is available in the conversation, an Agent with Memory will store it in the database. It will later be able to retrieve that information when relevant, effectively **learning about the user**!

## Usage

To get started, let's setup a basic Agent with Memory. For that, you will need to setup a database and configure your Agent as follows:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

# Setup your database
db = SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db")

# Setup your Agent with Memory
agent = Agent(
    db=db,
    enable_user_memories=True, # This enables Memory for the Agent
)
```

### Agentic Memory

When configuring your Agent with `enable_user_memories=True`, memories will be automatically created/updated after each run.

You can also give the Agent full control over the memory management by using `enable_agentic_memory=True`:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

# Setup your database
db = SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db")

# Setup your Agent with Memory
agent = Agent(
    db=db,
    enable_agentic_memory=True, # This enables Agentic Memory for the Agent
)
```

In this case, the Agent will be equipped with a tool to create, update or delete memories when it deems it relevant.

## Where are memories stored?

Memories are stored in the database you provide to the Agent. In the [Storage](/concepts/db/overview) section, you can read more about adding a database to your Agent and which databases are supported.

By default, memories are stored in the `agno_memories` table of the database.

If the table or collection doesn't exist, it is created automatically when first storing a memory.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.postgres import PostgresDb

# Setup your database
db = PostgresDb(
    db_url="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/my_database",
    memory_table="my_memory_table", # Specify the table to store memories
)

# Setup your Agent with the database
agent = Agent(db=db, enable_user_memories=True)

# Run the Agent. This will store a session in our "my_memory_table"
agent.print_response("Hi! My name is John Doe and I like to play basketball on the weekends.")

agent.print_response("What are my hobbies?")
```

### Retrieval

You can manually retrieve memories about a certain user from the database using the `get_user_memories` method:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.postgres import PostgresDb

# Setup your database
db = PostgresDb(
    db_url="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/my_database",
    memory_table="my_memory_table", # Specify the table to store memories
)

# Setup your Agent with the database
agent = Agent(db=db)

# Run the Agent. This will store a memory in our "my_memory_table"
agent.print_response("I love sushi!", user_id="123")

# Retrieve the memories about the user
memories = agent.get_user_memories(user_id="123")
print(memories)
```

## Data Model

These are the fields stored in the database when using Memory:

| Field        | Type   | Description                                     |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `memory_id`  | `str`  | The unique identifier for the memory.           |
| `memory`     | `dict` | The memory data, stored as a JSON object.       |
| `topics`     | `list` | The topics of the memory.                       |
| `input`      | `str`  | The input that generated the memory.            |
| `user_id`    | `str`  | The user ID of the memory.                      |
| `agent_id`   | `str`  | The agent ID of the memory.                     |
| `team_id`         | `str`  | The team ID of the memory.                      |
| `updated_at` | `int`  | The timestamp when the memory was last updated. |

This data is best displayed on the [Memories page of the AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com/memory).
