## Overview

You can build, test, and improve your AgentOS locally, but to run it in production you’ll need to deploy it to your own infrastructure. Because it’s pure Python code, you’re free to deploy AgentOS anywhere. To make things easier, we’ve also put together a set of ready to use templates - standardized codebases you can use to quickly deploy AgentOS to your own infrastructure.

Currently supported templates:

Docker Template: [agent-infra-docker](https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-infra-docker)
AWS Template: [agent-infra-aws](https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-infra-aws)

Coming soon:

- Modal Template
- Railway Template
- Render Template
- GCP Template

## What is A Template?

A template is a standardized codebase for a production AgentOS. It contains:

- An AgentOS instance using FastAPI.
- A Database for storing Sessions, Memories, Knowledge and Evals.

They are setup to run locally using docker and on cloud providers. They're a fantastic starting point and exactly what we use for our customers. You'll definitely need to customize them to fit your specific needs, but they'll get you started much faster.

## Here's How They Work

**Step 1**: Create your codebase using: `ag infra create` and choose a template.

This will clone one of our templates and give you a starting point.

**Step 2**: `cd` into your codebase and run locally using docker: `ag infra up`

This will start your AgentOS instance and PostgreSQL database locally using docker.

**Step 3 (For AWS template)**: Run on AWS: `ag infra up prd:aws`

This will start your AgentOS instance and PostgreSQL database on AWS.

We recommend starting with the `agent-infra-docker` template and taking it from there.
