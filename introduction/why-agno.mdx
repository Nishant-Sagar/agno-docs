title: Why Agno?
---

Agent development is a systems problem (infrastructure, software, context, security) and Agno is the only framework that delivers a complete solution. Agno gives you:

1. The fastest framework for building agents, multi-agent teams and agentic workflows.
2. A high-performance API for running secure, multi-agent systems in your cloud.
3. A powerful control plane for monitoring, managing and testing your agentic system.
4. Built-in session management, memory, knowledge, human in the loop and MCP support.
5. SSE compatible API endpoints for building your agentic product.

While most frameworks (or even rolling your own) will eventually get you a working agent, Agno's real advantage is its architecture. Without Agno, you send traces to external services for monitoring, paying per trace retention and egress costs. Above all, **you don't own your data**.

With Agno, every Agent run is stored in your database and your control plane cab read this data by directly connecting to your AgentOS. You own your data and it never leaves your system. This is a novel architecture that no other framework provides, your AgentOS runs securely in your cloud, and the control plane connects directly to it. You don't need to send traces to external services, you get complete data privacy and control.
