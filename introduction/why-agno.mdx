AI engineering is a systems problem (infrastructure, software, context, security) and Agno is the only framework that delivers a complete solution with a delightful developer experience.

You get the fastest framework for building agents with out of the box session management, memory, knowledge, human in the loop and MCP support, this helps you build and iterate quickly.

But to be honest, you can probably get there using other frameworks or rolling your own, it'll take extra effort and your code won't be as performant, but you'll get there.

The real advantage of Agno is the AgentOS runtime:

1. You get a FastAPI app with pre-built API endpoints, meaning you get started with building your product on day one. This is a remarkable advantage over other solutions.
2. You get a control plane which connects directly to the FastAPI app for testing, monitoring and managing your agentic system. This gives you unmatched control over your system.
3. Your AgentOS runs in your cloud and you get complete data control because no data ever leaves your system. This is incredible for security conscious enterprises.

With Agno, you can build your agents, ship them to production with a pre-built FastAPI app, scale it horizontally and keep your data private and secure. If your goal is to build your product as quickly as possible, Agno get's you there while delivering the best developer experience.

If you're an enterprise that's worried about data privacy and security, Agno is the only framework that gives you complete control over your data. Your AgentOS runs securely in your cloud, what could be more private than that?

<Tip>

Why owning your data is important:

- **Data control & compliance:** PII/prompts/tool payloads never leave your VPC. Easier GDPR/SOC2/DPAs and customer deals. This is especially important for enterprises.
- **Lower latency & fewer hops:** no proxy round-trips to third-party observability.
- **Unified source of truth:** runs, state, memory, tools, costs, evals live together.
- **Cost predictability:** youâ€™re not double-paying storage/egress and get infinite retention.
- **Security/RBAC:** you can add data controls at the user/agent level with built in audit logs.
