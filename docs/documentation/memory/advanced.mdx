### Memories in context

If you set `enable_user_memories=True` or `enable_agentic_memory=True`, the memories will be added to the context of the Agent automatically.

You can optionally disable this by setting `add_memories_to_context=False`.

For example:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SQLiteDb

db = SQLiteDb(db_file="agno.db")

agent = Agent(db=db, enable_user_memories=True, add_memories_to_context=False)

```

In the example above, memories are still created at the end of a run, but the agent won't have access to those memories in its context.
