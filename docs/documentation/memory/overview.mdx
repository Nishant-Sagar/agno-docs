title: What is Memory?
description: Memory gives an Agent the ability to recall information about the user.
sidebarTitle: Overview
---

Using **Memory**, you can enable your Agents to recall information about the user.

When relevant information about the user is available in the conversation, an Agent with Memory will store it in the database. It will later be able to retrieve that information when relevant, effectively **learning about the user**!


## Usage

Agno natively supports Agentic Memory Management, and recommends it as the starting point to Memory.

With Agentic Memory, your Agent itself will create, update and delete memories about the user.

To setup Memory for your Agent, you will need to setup a database and configure your Agent as follows:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SQLiteDb

# Setup your database
db = SQLiteDb(db_file="agno.db")

# Setup your Agent with Memory
agent = Agent(
    db=db,
    enable_user_memories=True, # This enables Memory for the Agent
)
```

### Agentic Memory

When configuring your Agent with `enable_user_memories=True`, memories will be created/updated after each run.

To give your Agent more control over the memories, you can instead use `enable_agentic_memory=True`:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SQLiteDb

# Setup your database
db = SQLiteDb(db_file="agno.db")

# Setup your Agent with Memory
agent = Agent(
    db=db,
    enable_agentic_memory=True, # This enables Agentic Memory for the Agent
)
```

In this case, the Agent will be equipped with a tool to create, update or delete memories when it deems it relevant.


### Where are memories stored?

Memories are stored in the database you provide to the Agent. In the [Storage](/db/introduction) section, you can read more about adding a database to your Agent and which databases are supported.

By default, memories are stored in the `agno_memories` table of the database.

If the table or collection doesn't exist, it is created automatically when first storing a memory.

You can specify where the sessions are stored exactly using the `session_table` parameter:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.postgres import PostgresDb

# Setup your database
db = PostgresDb(
    db_url="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/my_database",
    session_table="my_session_table", # Specify the table to store sessions
)

# Setup your Agent with the database
agent = Agent(db=db)

# Run the Agent. This will store a session in our "my_session_table"
agent.print_response("What is the capital of France?")
```

### Data Model

These are the fields stored in the database when using Memory:

- **memory_id** - Unique identifier for the memory
- **user_id** - The ID of the user that the memory is about
- **agent_id** - The ID of the Agent that created the memory
- **memory** - The content of the memory
- **topics** - The topics associated with the memory
- **updated_at** - The timestamp of the last update
