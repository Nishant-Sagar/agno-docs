Leverage DashScope's powerful command models and more.

[DashScope](https://dashscope.aliyun.com/) supports a wide range of models

We recommend experimenting to find the best-suited model for your use-case. Here are some general recommendations:

- `qwen-plus` model is good for most use-cases.

## Authentication

Set your `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` environment variable. Get your key from [here](https://dashscope.aliyun.com/api-keys).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=***
```

```bash Windows
setx DASHSCOPE_API_KEY ***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `DashScope` with your `Agent`:

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.dashscope import DashScope

agent = Agent(
    model=DashScope(id="qwen-plus"),
    markdown=True
)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")

```

</CodeGroup>
