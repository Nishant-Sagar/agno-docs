Agno supports using local JSON files as a "database" with the `JsonDb` class.
This is a simple way to store your Agent's session data without having to setup a database.

<Warning>
Using JSON files as a database is not recommended for production applications.
Use it for demos, testing and any other use case where you don't want to setup a database.
</Warning>

## Usage

```python json_for_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.json import JsonDb

# Setup the JSON database
db = JsonDb(db_path="tmp/json_db")

# Setup your Agent with the Database
agent = Agent(db=db)
```
