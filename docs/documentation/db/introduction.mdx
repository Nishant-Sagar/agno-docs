Storage provides a way to persist Agent, Team, and Workflow data to a database or file. 
Adding storage to an Agent, Team or Workflow  is as simple as providing a database connection and Agno handles the rest. 
You can use Sqlite, Postgres, Mongo or any other database you want.

## Benefits of Storage

Storage has typically been an under-discussed part of Agent Engineering -- but we see it as the unsung hero of production agentic applications.

In production, you need storage to:

- Continue sessions: retrieve sessions history and pick up where you left off.
- Get list of sessions: To continue a previous session, you need to maintain a list of sessions available for that agent.
- Save state between runs: save the Agent's state to a database or file so you can inspect it later.

But there is so much more:

- Storage saves our Agent's session data for inspection and evaluations.
- Storage helps us extract few-shot examples, which can be used to improve the Agent.
- Storage enables us to build internal monitoring tools and dashboards.

<Warning>
Storage is such a critical part of your Agentic infrastructure that it should never be offloaded to a third party. You should almost always use your own storage layer for your Agents.
</Warning>


## Example

Here's a simple example that demostrates persistence across execution cycles:

```python storage.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from rich.pretty import pprint

db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/data.db")

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    # Fix the session id to continue the same session across execution cycles
    session_id="fixed_id_for_demo",
    db=db,
    add_history_to_messages=True,
    num_history_runs=3,
)
agent.print_response("What was my last question?")
agent.print_response("What is the capital of France?")
agent.print_response("What was my last question?")
pprint(agent.get_messages_for_session())
```
