---

Storage provides a way to persist Agent, Team, and Workflow data  to a database or file. Adding storage to an Agent, Team or Workflow  is as simple as providing a `Storage` driver and Agno handles the rest. You can use Sqlite, Postgres, Mongo or any other database you want.

## Storage Interface


** common args accross all storage drivers:**
- `session_table (Optional[str])`: Name of the table to store Agent, Team and Workflow sessions.
- `memory_table (Optional[str])`: Name of the table to store memories.
- `metrics_table (Optional[str])`: Name of the table to store metrics.
- `eval_table (Optional[str])`: Name of the table to store evaluation runs data.
- `knowledge_table (Optional[str])`: Name of the table to store knowledge content.


The first time you run this, the answer to "What was my last question?" will not be available. But run it again and the Agent will able to answer properly. Because we have fixed the session id, the Agent will continue from the same session every time you run the script.

## Benefits of Storage

Storage has typically been an under-discussed part of Agent Engineering -- but we see it as the unsung hero of production agentic applications.

In production, you need storage to:

- Continue sessions: retrieve sessions history and pick up where you left off.
- Get list of sessions: To continue a previous session, you need to maintain a list of sessions available for that agent.
- Save state between runs: save the Agent's state to a database or file so you can inspect it later.

But there is so much more:

- Storage saves our Agent's session data for inspection and evaluations.
- Storage helps us extract few-shot examples, which can be used to improve the Agent.
- Storage enables us to build internal monitoring tools and dashboards.

<Warning>
Storage is such a critical part of your Agentic infrastructure that it should never be offloaded to a third party. You should almost always use your own storage layer for your Agents.

## AgentOS  Example

**AgentOS** is a comprehensive framework for building, deploying, and managing Agent Systems. It provides a unified platform to create intelligent agents, organize them into teams, orchestrate complex workflows, and deploy them across various interfaces like web APIs, Slack, WhatsApp, and more.

The `AgentOS` serves as an API client to the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com).

Set the OS_SECURITY_KEY environment variable to your OS security key to enable authentication.

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
pip install -U fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy pgvector psycopg openai ddgs
```
