Agno supports using [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) as a database with the `DynamoDb` class.

## Usage

To connect to DynamoDB, you will need valid AWS credentials. You can set them as environment variables:

- `AWS_REGION`: The AWS region to connect to.
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key id.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret access key.

```python dynamo_for_agent.py
from agno.db.dynamo import DynamoDb

# Setup your Database
db = DynamoDb()

# Setup your Agent with the Database
agent = Agent(db=db)
```
