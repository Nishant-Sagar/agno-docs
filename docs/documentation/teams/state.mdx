Team Session State enables sophisticated state management across teams of agents. Teams often need to coordinate on shared information.

Shared state propagates through nested team structures as well

## How to use Shared State

You can set the `session_state` parameter on `Team` to share state between the team leader and team members.
This state is available to all team members and is synchronized between them.

For example:

```python
team = Team(
    members=[agent1, agent2, agent3],
    session_state={"shopping_list": []},
)
```

Members can access the shared state using the `session_state` attribute in tools.

For example:

```python
def add_item(session_state, item: str) -> str:
    """Add an item to the shopping list and return confirmation.

    Args:
        item (str): The item to add to the shopping list.
    """
    # Add the item if it's not already in the list
    if item.lower() not in [
        i.lower() for i in session_state["shopping_list"]
    ]:
        session_state["shopping_list"].append(item)
        return f"Added '{item}' to the shopping list"
    else:
        return f"'{item}' is already in the shopping list"
```

<Note>
The `session_state` variable is automatically passed to the tool as an argument.  Any updates to it is automatically reflected in the shared state.
</Note>

### Example

Here's a simple example of a team managing a shared shopping list:


```python team_session_state.py
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.team import Team


# Define tools that work with shared team state
def add_item(session_state, item: str) -> str:
    """Add an item to the shopping list."""
    if item.lower() not in [
        i.lower() for i in session_state["shopping_list"]
    ]:
        session_state["shopping_list"].append(item)
        return f"Added '{item}' to the shopping list"
    else:
        return f"'{item}' is already in the shopping list"


def remove_item(session_state, item: str) -> str:
    """Remove an item from the shopping list."""
    for i, list_item in enumerate(session_state["shopping_list"]):
        if list_item.lower() == item.lower():
            session_state["shopping_list"].pop(i)
            return f"Removed '{list_item}' from the shopping list"
    
    return f"'{item}' was not found in the shopping list"


# Create an agent that manages the shopping list
shopping_agent = Agent(
    name="Shopping List Agent",
    role="Manage the shopping list",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    tools=[add_item, remove_item],
)


# Define team-level tools
def list_items(session_state) -> str:
    """List all items in the shopping list."""
    # Access shared state (not private state)
    shopping_list = session_state["shopping_list"]
    
    if not shopping_list:
        return "The shopping list is empty."
    
    items_text = "\n".join([f"- {item}" for item in shopping_list])
    return f"Current shopping list:\n{items_text}"


def add_chore(session_state, chore: str) -> str:
    """Add a completed chore to the team's private log."""
    # Access team's private state
    if "chores" not in session_state:
        session_state["chores"] = []
    
    session_state["chores"].append(chore)
    return f"Logged chore: {chore}"


# Create a team with both shared and private state
shopping_team = Team(
    name="Shopping Team",
    mode="coordinate",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    members=[shopping_agent],
    session_state={"shopping_list": [], "chores": []},
    tools=[list_items, add_chore],
    instructions=[
        "You manage a shopping list.",
        "Forward add/remove requests to the Shopping List Agent.",
        "Use list_items to show the current list.",
        "Log completed tasks using add_chore.",
    ],
)

# Example usage
shopping_team.print_response("Add milk, eggs, and bread", stream=True)
print(f"Shared state: {shopping_team.get_session_state()}")

shopping_team.print_response("What's on my list?", stream=True)

shopping_team.print_response("I got the eggs", stream=True)
print(f"Shared state: {shopping_team.get_session_state()}")
```

<Tip> 
Notice how shared tools use `session_state`, which allows state to propagate and persist across the entire team â€” even for subteams within the team. This ensures consistent shared state for all members.

## Agentic Session State

Agno provides a way to allow the team and team members to automatically update the shared session state.

Simply set the `enable_agentic_state` parameter to `True`.

```python agentic_session_state.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.team.team import Team

db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agents.db")
shopping_agent = Agent(
    name="Shopping List Agent",
    role="Manage the shopping list",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="o3-mini"),
    db=db,
    add_session_state_to_context=True,  # Required so the agent is aware of the session state
    enable_agentic_state=True,
)

team = Team(
    members=[shopping_agent],
    session_state={"shopping_list": []},
    db=db,
    add_session_state_to_context=True,  # Required so the team is aware of the session state
    enable_agentic_state=True,
    description="You are a team that manages a shopping list and chores",
    show_members_responses=True,
)


team.print_response("Add milk, eggs, and bread to the shopping list")

team.print_response("I picked up the eggs, now what's on my list?")

print(f"Session state: {team.get_session_state()}")
```

<Tip>
Don't forget to set `add_session_state_to_context=True` to make the session state available to the team's context.
</Tip>


## Using state in instructions

You can reference variables from the session state in your instructions.

<Tip>
Don't use the f-string syntax in the instructions. Directly use the `{key}` syntax, Agno substitutes the values for you.
</Tip>

```python state_in_instructions.py
from agno.team.team import Team

team = Team(
    members=[],
    # Initialize the session state with a variable
    session_state={"user_name": "John"},
    instructions="Users name is {user_name}",
    markdown=True,
)

team.print_response("What is my name?", stream=True)
```

## Changing state on run

When you pass `session_id` to the team on `team.run()`, it will switch to the session with the given `session_id` and load any state that was set on that session.

This is useful when you want to continue a session for a specific user.

```python changing_state_on_run.py
from agno.team.team import Team
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.db.in_memory import InMemoryDb

team = Team(
    db=InMemoryDb(),
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    members=[],
    instructions="Users name is {user_name} and age is {age}",
)

# Sets the session state for the session with the id "user_1_session_1"
team.print_response("What is my name?", session_id="user_1_session_1", user_id="user_1", session_state={"user_name": "John", "age": 30})

# Will load the session state from the session with the id "user_1_session_1"
team.print_response("How old am I?", session_id="user_1_session_1", user_id="user_1")

# Sets the session state for the session with the id "user_2_session_1"
team.print_response("What is my name?", session_id="user_2_session_1", user_id="user_2", session_state={"user_name": "Jane", "age": 25})

# Will load the session state from the session with the id "user_2_session_1"
team.print_response("How old am I?", session_id="user_2_session_1", user_id="user_2")
```

## Team Member Interactions

Agent Teams can share interactions between members, allowing agents to learn from each other's outputs:

```python
from agno.agent.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.team.team import Team

from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agents.db")

web_research_agent = Agent(
    name="Web Research Agent",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="o3-mini"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions="You are a web research agent that can answer questions from the web.",
)

report_agent = Agent(
    name="Report Agent",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="o3-mini"),
    instructions="You are a report agent that can write a report from the web research.",
)

team = Team(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="o3-mini"),
    db=db,
    members=[web_research_agent, report_agent],
    share_member_interactions=True,
    instructions=[
        "You are a team of agents that can research the web and write a report.",
        "First, research the web for information about the topic.",
        "Then, use your report agent to write a report from the web research.",
    ],
    show_members_responses=True,
    debug_mode=True,
)

team.print_response("How are LEDs made?")
```
