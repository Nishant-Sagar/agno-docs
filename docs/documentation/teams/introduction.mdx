A Team is a collection of Agents (or other sub-teams) that work together to accomplish tasks. Teams can either **"coordinate"**, **"collaborate"** or **"route"** to solve a task.

A `Team` has a list of `members` that can be instances of either `Agent` or `Team`.

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent

team = Team(members=[
    Agent(name="Agent 1", role="You answer questions in English"),
    Agent(name="Agent 2", role="You answer questions in Chinese"),
    Team(name="Team 1", role="You answer questions in French"),
])
```

The team will transfer tasks to the members depending on the `mode` of the team.

As with agents, teams support the following features:
- **Model:** Set the model that is used by the "team leader" to delegate tasks to the team members.
- **Instructions:** Instruct the team leader on how to solve problems. The names, descriptions and roles of team members are automatically provided to the team leader.
- **Tools:** If the team leader needs to be able to use tools directly, you can add tools to the team.
- **Reasoning:** Enables the team leader to "think" before responding or delegating tasks to team members, and "analyze" the results of team members' responses.
- **Knowledge:** If the team needs to search for information, you can add a knowledge base to the team. This is accessible to the team leader.
- **Storage:** The Team's session history and state is stored in a database. This enables your team to continue conversations from where they left off, enabling multi-turn, long-term conversations.
- **Memory:** Gives Teams the ability to store and recall information from previous interactions, allowing them to learn user preferences and personalize their responses.

<Tip>
It is recommended to specify the `name` and the `role` fields of each team member, for better identification by the team leader.
</Tip>

## Modes

Teams can be configured to work in one of three modes:

### Coordinate Mode

In [**Coordinate Mode**](/docs/documentation/teams/coordinate), the team leader delegates tasks to team members and synthesizes their outputs into a single cohesive response. 
The team leader can send tasks to multiple members at once, or one after the other depending on the request and what the model decides is most appropriate.

<Note>
In `async` execution, if more than one member is delegated to at once by the team leader, these members are run concurrently.
</Note>

### Route Mode

In [**Route Mode**](/docs/documentation/teams/route), the team leader forwards your run input to the most appropriate team member based on the content of the input. The member's response is returned directly to the user and the team leader doesn't interpret/transform the response.

<Note>
In `async` execution, if more than one member is forwarded to at once by the team leader, these members are run concurrently.
</Note>


### Collaborate Mode

In [**Collaborate Mode**](/docs/documentation/teams/collaborate), all team members are given the same task and the team leader synthesizes their outputs into a cohesive response. 

<Note>
In `async` execution, all the members are run concurrently.
