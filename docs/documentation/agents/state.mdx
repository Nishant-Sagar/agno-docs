title: Agent State
---

**State** is any kind of data the Agent needs to maintain throughout runs.

<Check>
A simple yet common use case for Agents is to manage lists, items and other "information" for a user. For example, a shopping list, a todo list, a wishlist, etc.

This can be easily managed using the `session_state`. The Agent updates the `session_state` in tool calls and exposes them to the Model in the `description` and `instructions`.
</Check>

Agno's provides a powerful and elegant state management system, here's how it works:

- The `Agent` has a `session_state` parameter.
- We add our state variables to this `session_state` dictionary.
- We update the `session_state` dictionary in tool calls or other functions.
- We share the current `session_state` with the Model in the `description` and `instructions`.
- The `session_state` is stored with Agent sessions and is persisted in a database. Meaning, it is available across execution cycles. This also means when switching sessions between calls to `agent.run()`, the state is loaded and available.
- You can also pass `session_state` to the agent on `agent.run()`, effectively overriding any state that was set on Agent initialization.

Here's an example of an Agent managing a shopping list:

```python session_state.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

def add_item(session_state, item: str) -> str:
    """Add an item to the shopping list."""
    session_state["shopping_list"].append(item)  # type: ignore
    return f"The shopping list is now {session_state['shopping_list']}"  # type: ignore


# Create an Agent that maintains state
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    # Initialize the session state with a counter starting at 0 (this is the default session state for all users)
    session_state={"shopping_list": []},
    tools=[add_item],
    # You can use variables from the session state in the instructions
    instructions="Current state (shopping list) is: {shopping_list}",
    markdown=True,
)

# Example usage
agent.print_response("Add milk, eggs, and bread to the shopping list", stream=True)
print(f"Final session state: {agent.get_session_state()}")
```

<Tip>
This is as good and elegant as state management gets.
</Tip>

## Maintaining state across multiple runs

A big advantage of **sessions** is the ability to maintain state across multiple runs. For example, let's say the agent is helping a user keep track of their shopping list.

<Note>
By setting `add_state_in_messages=True`, the keys of the `session_state` dictionary are available in the `description` and `instructions` as variables.

Use this pattern to add the shopping_list to the instructions directly.
</Note>

```python shopping_list.py
from textwrap import dedent

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat


# Define tools to manage our shopping list
def add_item(session_state, item: str) -> str:
    """Add an item to the shopping list and return confirmation."""
    # Add the item if it's not already in the list
    if item.lower() not in [i.lower() for i in session_state["shopping_list"]]:
        session_state["shopping_list"].append(item)  # type: ignore
        return f"Added '{item}' to the shopping list"
    else:
        return f"'{item}' is already in the shopping list"


def remove_item(session_state, item: str) -> str:
    """Remove an item from the shopping list by name."""
    # Case-insensitive search
    for i, list_item in enumerate(session_state["shopping_list"]):
        if list_item.lower() == item.lower():
            session_state["shopping_list"].pop(i)
            return f"Removed '{list_item}' from the shopping list"

    return f"'{item}' was not found in the shopping list"


def list_items(session_state) -> str:
    """List all items in the shopping list."""
    shopping_list = session_state["shopping_list"]

    if not shopping_list:
        return "The shopping list is empty."

    items_text = "\n".join([f"- {item}" for item in shopping_list])
    return f"Current shopping list:\n{items_text}"


# Create a Shopping List Manager Agent that maintains state
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="o3-mini"),
    # Initialize the session state with an empty shopping list (default session state for all sessions)
    session_state={"shopping_list": []},
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/example.db"),
    tools=[add_item, remove_item, list_items],
    # You can use variables from the session state in the instructions
    instructions=dedent("""\
        Your job is to manage a shopping list.

        The shopping list starts empty. You can add items, remove items by name, and list all items.

        Current shopping list: {shopping_list}
    """),
    markdown=True,
)

# Example usage
agent.print_response("Add milk, eggs, and bread to the shopping list", stream=True)
print(f"Session state: {agent.get_session_state()}")

agent.print_response("I got bread", stream=True)
print(f"Session state: {agent.get_session_state()}")

agent.print_response("I need apples and oranges", stream=True)
print(f"Session state: {agent.get_session_state()}")

agent.print_response("whats on my list?", stream=True)
print(f"Session state: {agent.get_session_state()}")

agent.print_response(
    "Clear everything from my list and start over with just bananas and yogurt",
    stream=True,
)
print(f"Session state: {agent.get_session_state()}")
```

<Tip>
State is a great way to control context across multiple runs.
</Tip>


## Using state in instructions

You can use variables from the session state in the instructions by setting `add_state_in_messages=True`.

<Tip>
Don't use the f-string syntax in the instructions. Directly use the `{key}` syntax, Agno substitutes the values for you.
</Tip>

```python state_in_instructions.py
from textwrap import dedent

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat


agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    # Initialize the session state with a variable
    session_state={"user_name": "John"},
    # You can use variables from the session state in the instructions
    instructions="Users name is {user_name}",
    add_state_in_messages=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent.print_response("What is my name?", stream=True)
```

## Changing state on run

When you pass `session_id` to the agent on `agent.run()`, it will switch to the session with the given `session_id` and load any state that was set on that session.

This is useful when you want to continue a session for a specific user.

```python changing_state_on_run.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    add_state_in_messages=True,
    instructions="Users name is {user_name} and age is {age}",
)

# Sets the session state for the session with the id "user_1_session_1"
agent.print_response("What is my name?", session_id="user_1_session_1", user_id="user_1", session_state={"user_name": "John", "age": 30})

# Will load the session state from the session with the id "user_1_session_1"
agent.print_response("How old am I?", session_id="user_1_session_1", user_id="user_1")

# Sets the session state for the session with the id "user_2_session_1"
agent.print_response("What is my name?", session_id="user_2_session_1", user_id="user_2", session_state={"user_name": "Jane", "age": 25})

# Will load the session state from the session with the id "user_2_session_1"
agent.print_response("How old am I?", session_id="user_2_session_1", user_id="user_2")
```


## Persisting state in database

`session_state` is part of the Agent session and is saved to the database after each run if a `storage` driver is provided.

Here's an example of an Agent that maintains a shopping list and persists the state in a database. Run this script multiple times to see the state being persisted.

```python session_state_storage.py
"""Run `pip install agno openai sqlalchemy` to install dependencies."""

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb


# Define a tool that adds an item to the shopping list
def add_item(session_state, item: str) -> str:
    """Add an item to the shopping list."""
    if item not in session_state["shopping_list"]:
        session_state["shopping_list"].append(item)  # type: ignore
    return f"The shopping list is now {session_state['shopping_list']}"  # type: ignore


agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    # Fix the session id to continue the same session across execution cycles
    session_id="fixed_id_for_demo",
    # Initialize the session state with an empty shopping list
    session_state={"shopping_list": []},
    # Add a tool that adds an item to the shopping list
    tools=[add_item],
    # Store the session state in a SQLite database
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/data.db"),
    # Add the current shopping list from the state in the instructions
    instructions="Current shopping list is: {shopping_list}",
    # Important: Set `add_state_in_messages=True`
    # to make `{shopping_list}` available in the instructions
    add_state_in_messages=True,
    markdown=True,
)

# Example usage
agent.print_response("What's on my shopping list?", stream=True)
print(f"Session state: {agent.get_session_state()}")
agent.print_response("Add milk, eggs, and bread", stream=True)
print(f"Session state: {agent.get_session_state()}")
```
