title: Cursor Rules for Building Agents
description: Use .cursorrules to improve AI coding assistant suggestions when building agents with Agno
---

A `.cursorrules` file teaches AI coding assistants (like Cursor, Windsurf) how to build better agents with Agno.

## What is .cursorrules?

`.cursorrules` is a configuration file that provides your AI coding assistant with:
- Agno-specific patterns and best practices
- Correct parameter names and syntax
- Common mistakes to avoid
- When to use Agent vs Team vs Workflow

Think of it as a reference guide that helps your AI assistant build agents correctly with Agno.

## Why Use It?

Without `.cursorrules`, AI assistants might suggest:
- Wrong parameter names (like `agents=` instead of `members=` for Teams)
- Outdated patterns or incorrect syntax
- Performance anti-patterns (creating agents in loops)
- Non-existent methods or features

With `.cursorrules`, your AI will:
- Suggest correct Agno patterns automatically
- Follow performance best practices
- Use the right approach for your use case
- Catch common mistakes before you make them

## How to Use .cursorrules

Copy the Agno `.cursorrules` file to your project root:

```bash
# Download the .cursorrules file
curl -o .cursorrules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agno-agi/agno/main/.cursorrules

# Or clone and copy
git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agno.git
cp agno/.cursorrules /path/to/your/project/
```

Your AI assistant (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) will automatically detect and use it.

### For Your Own Projects

When building your own agent application, the `.cursorrules` file will help your AI assistant suggest correct patterns. Here are examples of what it teaches:

**Correct Team syntax:**
```python
team = Team(
    members=[agent1, agent2],  # Uses 'members', not 'agents'
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
)
```

**Performance best practice:**
```python
# Reuse agents (don't create in loops)
agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"))
for query in queries:
    agent.run(query)  # Fast!
```

**Structured output:**
```python
# Use Pydantic for validation
class Result(BaseModel):
    summary: str
    findings: list[str]

result = agent.run(query, response_model=Result)
```

## What's Included

The Agno `.cursorrules` file teaches your AI about:

**Core Patterns**
- When to use Agent, Team, or Workflow
- Agent design patterns (Specialist, Coordinator, RAG-powered, Stateful)
- How to add tools, memory, and knowledge to agents

**Best Practices**
- Performance rules (reuse agents, control context size)
- Error handling patterns
- Structured output with Pydantic
- Testing strategies
- Production deployment checklist

**Common Mistakes**
- Don't create agents in loops
- Limit tools per agent (5-8 max)
- Use clear, specific instructions
- Always handle errors
- Use PostgreSQL in production (not SQLite)

## IDE Support

`.cursorrules` works with:
- **Cursor** - Automatic detection
- **Windsurf** - Native support
- **Other AI assistants** - May vary by tool

<Note>
The `.cursorrules` file is focused on **building agents with Agno**. If you're contributing to the Agno framework itself, that will be covered separately.
