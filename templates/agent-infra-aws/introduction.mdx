sidebarTitle: Run AgentOS on AWS

The Agent Infra AWS template provides a simple AWS infrastructure for running AgentOS. It contains:

- An AgentOS instance, serving Agents, Teams, Workflows and utilities using FastAPI.
- A PostgreSQL database for storing sessions, memories and knowledge.

You can run your Agent Infra AWS locally as well as on AWS. This guide goes over the local setup first.
