title: Standardized Templates for AgentOS
sidebarTitle: Overview
---

When building a production instance of AgentOS, you'll need to host your AgentOS in your own cloud and connect it os.agno.com.

# What are Templates?

**Templates are standardized codebases for production AgentOS.** They contain:

- An AgentOS instance using FastAPI.
- A PostgreSQL database for storing sessions, memories and knowledge.

Templates are setup to run locally using docker and be easily deployed to AWS. They're a fantastic starting point and exactly what we use for our customers. You'll definitely need to customize them to fit your specific needs, but they'll get you started much faster.

They contain years of learnings, available for free for the open-source community.

# Here's how they work

- Create your codebase using: `ag infra create`
- Run locally using docker: `ag infra up`
- Run on AWS: `ag infra up prd:aws`

We recommend starting with the `agent-infra-docker` template and taking it from there.
